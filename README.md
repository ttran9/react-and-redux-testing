- Purpose:

  - Shortly after going through a React and Redux assignment for a technical interview which I couldn't complete I stumbled across this video after looking for an introduction on testing using React and Redux. I am making this repository to have a reference. I will be creating branches for each individual video. My initial upload will have changes up to the end of video 1.
  - A link to the playlist is [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Db3tEF6pB8Am-IhCRgyGSxTalkDpUV_)

- Video 1:
  - There was an error I encountered relating to using Jest as a dev dependency so I have removed this from the package.json file.

* Other Build Note(s):
  - This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
